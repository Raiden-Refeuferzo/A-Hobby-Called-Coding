        <p>Coding, it is a power of creation and art and several other things. There are tons of possibilities, millions of chances to create something thats never been created, trillions of creativity. Some people might see coding as a boring, too much work, doesn't make sense. All of these thought are just in the mind, but once you unlocked your thought, it will open gateways of possibilities. <br /><br />Some people might not know it but coding is really fun, although debugging is kind of stressfull, its still fun. Once you finished the coding part and got on to the gaming or doing what ever the app or game is meant to do, you'll enjoy your project or be pleased with it according to the app. If you're still not convinced about the coding here's one more reason. Coding is the future, it can help millions and billions of people acheive greatness and so many other possibiliteis. For example, we can code robots to clean the Earth, we can code cars to avoid objects, we can code unmanned rovers to be sent on another planet to study. So as you can see, I love coding and I'm sure if you give it a try, you will too. </p>
